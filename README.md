## Inspiration
One of the biggest reasons why people don't donate to charity is not knowing the right place to go/people to contact in order to donate or how to do it, and even when we do, it may not be suitable for the objects we want to donate or it may have extra associated costs.
In that sense, GiveAway makes it easier to solve all these problems, given the fact that organisations would have no cost associated to being in the app, apart from having to deal with transportation of the objects, and donators wouldn’t need to leave their homes in order to donate, having the tools needed on the reach of their hands.
We believe that this would greatly benefit both the users (by giving them easier ways to get rid of all the things they don’t use or simply helping them help others) and charity organisations (by increasing the number of donations).
Apart from that, the gamification features might be able to motivate younger generations and keep them engaged, since they do not usually partake in as many charity-related activities as the elder ones.

## What it does
Based on idle-game upgrading system, upon doing a donation, the donator gets coins that they can use to either spin a roulette with prizes or upgrade their donations (to special donations, where they can donate the money and ask us to buy items for the charity, instead of donating the items themselves), or even get the chance of us duplicating their special donation

## How we built it
The app was programmed in Dart, using Flutter. To store the data we used Firebase

## Challenges we ran into
The application of the ideas into the Dart language, with which we had only worked with in one project with a lot of constraints that didn't allow us to fully explore it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The creativity of the app and the application of the upgrade-based idle game structure to a real life issue.

## What we learned
Acquired more project development and management skills, as well as product design and presentation, programming and organisation.

## What's next for GiveAway
The inclusion of further functionalities, some of them already thought out (like the saving up of vouchers, the adding of raffles or giveaways - hence the name), and some others that might come from feedback left by its users.

## How it works

Upon joining the app, a person can just start donating immediately, by clicking “Donate Now” and adding the details of the delivery and the organisation to donate to. Then, they can add up to 5 items (with their description) and after sending in the donation, they get 5 G coins.
These G coins may be used on buying Special Donations, which cost 15 G coins and consist of sending money instead of objects, and requesting to the organisation the purchase of certain products (by linking them or specifying the marketplace, otherwise the organisation will resort to their default markets). These donations can be useful for people that want to donate but have nothing to or may just want to give new products instead of used ones.
The G coins can also be used on the profile, where donators can spend 10 G coins to spin a wheel of prizes, which can be nothing, more coins, free special donations or double donations (in which we – the app creators – will cover the cost of a duplicated special donation, funded by the presence of advertisements in the app).
In order to join our app, an organisation just needs to insert their details and then wait for the confirmation. After that possible confirmation, if they fulfil the requisites, they can start receiving donations.
To improve the app, after finishing all the explained functionalities, we would like to allow donators to login, in order to be able to follow the state of their past donations, as well as adding another gamification feature, based on levels of donators or daily streaks, creating a tiered organisation, which might allow them to enter raffles or giveaways of prizes (in order to keep them engaged and motivated to donate even more).
